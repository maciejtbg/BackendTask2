# Pairs App

This is a simple Java application that finds pairs of integers in a given list whose sum is equal to 13. The pairs are then sorted and printed to the console.


## Usage

1. Run the `SortingApp` class.

2. Enter any number of integers one by one. When you are finished, press `Enter`.

3. You can uncomment proper line to input list directly from code.

4. The application will then find pairs of integers in the list that sum up to 13. The pairs are sorted and printed to the console.


## Dependencies

The application uses Java's built-in libraries and does not require any external dependencies.

## Notes

- The application uses a nested loop approach to find the pairs. It first sorts the input list to optimize the search process.

- If you want to use a predefined input list for testing purposes, you can uncomment the line in the `main` method that initializes `inputList`.

- The method `findPairs` performs the main logic of finding pairs.

- The `printOutput` method is responsible for printing the pairs to the console in expected form.

- The `getIntegerList` method allows you to input your list of integers through the console.
